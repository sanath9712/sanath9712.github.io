## Addressing Transient Workload Spikes with Cloud Bursting in Apache Flink
**Boston University** | Feb 2023 - May 2023

Developed a solution to tackle sudden workload spikes in Apache Flink by integrating Cloud Bursting, an innovative workload offloading technique. The approach:
- Replaced the traditional back-pressure mechanism with Cloud Bursting to redirect surplus workload to scalable cloud providers, like AWS.
- Ensured optimal system performance during workload surges by enabling Apache Flink to adapt to abrupt workload fluctuations.
- Achieved zero back pressure in all experimental tests, showcasing a significant enhancement to the Apache Flink framework.  
**Technical Skills:** Java, Apache Flink, Cloud Bursting, AWS, Distributed Stream Processing
